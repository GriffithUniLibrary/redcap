## Accessing REDCap for the first time

The Griffith REDCap instance1 is hosted at [www151.griffith.edu.au/redcap/](https://www151.griffith.edu.au/redcap/). The simplest way there is via [griffith.edu.au/survey-centre](https://www.griffith.edu.au/survey-centre).

REDCap logins are connected to the Griffith phonebook using LDAP. Your Griffith s-number and password allow you to enter. There is no need to maintain separate login details.

### Logging in to REDCap

1. Open a browser and using the search box to find the Research Survey Centre web page.
2. Log in to REDCap using your s-number and password.

## Home Menu

### My Projects

The following headings can be seen:

- **Records:** how many records (complete or partial) have been recorded for this project. This doesn't distinguish between records captured by researchers completing a form and records captured by participants completing a survey instrument.
- **Instrument:** An instrument is how data gets captured into REDCap. They can either be forms (for researchers to complete inside of REDCap) or surveys (for participants to complete on their own devices).
- **Type:** The type may either be classic or modern. This category doesn’t change and is irrelevant.
- **Status:** Can be in development (the wrench symbol) or production (the green tick). Once a project is in production, it can also be set to inactive and archived statuses.

### Help & FAQ

REDCap has an extensive, searchable help section built in. We encourage you to use it frequently.

### Send-It

Send-It is a secure file transfer application for sending recipients files up to 35 MB in size. We won’t be looking at it in this session.

### Messenger

REDCap includes a feature that allows you to send messages to your project collaborators within the web app. This could be useful where you want to keep conversations about your project in the same place as the project itself. We won’t be looking at it in this session.
